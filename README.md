# Cars Repo Example

An example used car dealership system logging make, range, model, derivative, colour, mileage, price, images and registration of vehicles

## Installation

```shell
git clone https://github.com/connf/cars.git
cd cars
composer install
touch database.sqlite
php artisan migrate
```

## CSV Importation

The system is designed to handle CSV files with columns in the following order:

`REG	MAKE	RANGE	MODEL	DERIVATIVE	PRICE_INC_VAT	COLOUR	MILEAGE	VEHICLE_TYPE	DATE_ON_FORECOURT	IMAGES`

Header names do **NOT** have to match those above and are indicative only

The first row should **ALWAYS** contain headers or an empty header row

The second row should be the **FIRST** row of data and will be referred to as **row 1** hereafter

To import a CSV execute the following command from the root of the */cars* repository cloned earlier:

```shell
php artisan vehicles:import {csv_file} {starting_row_number}
```

Where:
**csv_file:** is a filename as either filename.csv or ./filename.csv if in the */cars* folder, or a full file path to the CSV file to import
**starting_row_number:** is a number equal to or greater than 1 - or an empty value

For example:

```shell
php artisan vehicles:import example_stock.csv 50
```

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
